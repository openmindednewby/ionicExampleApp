Best Practices for Monorepos

    Use tools like Nx, Bazel, or Turborepo to optimize builds and testing.
    Implement a robust CI/CD pipeline to handle incremental builds and selective testing.
    Structure the repository to clearly separate projects and shared libraries.
    Establish clear guidelines for dependencies and code ownership.
    Use feature flags or versioned libraries to decouple updates across projects.

When to Choose a Monorepo

    If you have tightly coupled projects with shared components.
    When you aim to enforce consistent tooling, standards, and processes.
    For organizations where collaboration between teams is a priority.

When to Avoid a Monorepo

    If the projects are entirely unrelated and have no shared code.
    When you lack the necessary tooling or infrastructure to manage a large monorepo effectively.
    If granular access control is a critical requirement.

## Ionic Need To Know

## Service Worker

## Standalone


Enables treeshaking so the final build output only includes the code necessary to run your app which reduces overall build size.
Avoids the use of NgModules to streamline the development experience and make your code easier to understand.
Allows developers to also use newer Angular features such as ESBuild.
